# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

👋 Hi, I'm Pranjalee, and I'm thrilled to have you here! 

## About Me

👀 I'm passionate about coding, reading, and, when I need to unwind, binge-watching Netflix. I love exploring new technologies and building innovative projects. My main expertise lies in the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, and I'm always eager to learn and collaborate on exciting projects in this domain.

## What You'll Find Here

📚 In my repositories, you'll find a variety of projects and code snippets that showcase my skills and interests. These include:

- **MERN Stack Projects**: I enjoy working on full-stack applications using the MERN stack, combining powerful technologies to build scalable and robust web applications.
- **Code Snippets**: I often create and share useful code snippets that solve specific problems or demonstrate best practices.
- **Learning Resources**: I'm a firm believer in continuous learning, so you may find repositories dedicated to sharing tutorials, guides, and resources I've found helpful throughout my coding journey.
